This post shows how a blog entry can use headings, lists, quotes, and code. Replace the content with your own writing.

## Section headings

Use `##` for sections and `###` for subsections.

### Emphasis

Mix **bold** and _italic_. Nested emphasis also works (for example: **bold with _italic_**).

## Lists

- Idea one
- Idea two
- Idea three

1. Step one
2. Step two
3. Step three

## Quote

> Keep quotes short and meaningful.

## Code

```python
def hello(name):
    return f"Hello, {name}!"
```

## Wrap-up

End with a short summary or call-to-action.
